# HyperionDev-tht

### Section A
This section simulates a typical interaction that I might have with a student. I reviewed the hypothetical student submission by commenting on:
- Correctness
- Efficiency
- Style
- Documentation
- Postive aspects and improvements that are necessary while being encouraging

The task was completed in a Markdown file as required.

### Section B
I shared a GitHub URL to a data visualization HyperionDev capstone that I'm proud of and that I enjoyed completing.

### Section C
- The task I chose for this section is 'Say the Number' and the language that I chose to complete it in is Python. 
- I included the test suite along side my code.
- I included a seperate Markdown file for the report that specifies and justifies the worst-case space complexity of my solution.
- Only VScode was used, no other scripts are necessary to build, test and run my solution.

### Section D
I shared a Loom Video URL to an uploaded video of myself, answering the following questions:
- What is your experience as a developer?
- What is your experience as an educator?
- Working remotely, how do you deal with power and connectivity outages? Do you have a backup system?
