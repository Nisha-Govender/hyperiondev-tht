### Positive aspects of the submission
Great stuff, *name*. Keep up the good work!
Your logic is sound and your use of the 'groupAnagrams' function is well done.

### Aspects of the submission that could be improved
- Line 2: The indentation of the code is incorrect. The def groupAnagrams function and its content should be indented to show that they belong to the class Solution.
- Line 5: The sorted() function in the line x = "".join(sorted()) should have an argument of i. Without it, the sorted function will return an empty list, and thus the value of x will always be an empty string.
- Please add comments to your code. This helps others understand your reasoning and thought process for each section of your work.

### Overall feedback
Please re-submit this task with the revisions. I'm looking forward to the next submission!
